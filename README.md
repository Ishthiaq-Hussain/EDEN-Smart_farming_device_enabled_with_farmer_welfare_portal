## Smart_farming_device_enabled_with_farmer_welfare_portal
  This project is intended to develop a smart farming device which is more suited for polyhouses and indoor farming.The device monitors various soil and environment parameters like soil moisture,temperature,light intensity,CO2 level,PH level . It also identifies diseases and pest in the plant through machine learning.The monitored parameters are pushed to cloud (we used firebase) and are shown in the developed website which will be in the user end. The aim is to calculate the growth rate and predict the yeild so that various appropriate welfare schemes can be suggested to the framer accordingly.
  This idea has been prototyped in a hackathon.
